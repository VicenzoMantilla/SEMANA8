                Denmark will not use AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine for two weeks after reports that some recipients had
                developed serious blood clots, and in one case may have died as a result, the country’s authorities said on
                Thursday.
            </p>
            <p>
                They did not say how many reports of blood clots there had been, but Austria has stopped using a batch of
                AstraZeneca shots while investigating a death from coagulation disorders and an illness from a pulmonary
                embolism.

                    Danish health authorities said the country’s decision to suspend the shots for 14 days came after a
                    60-year
                    old woman in Denmark, who was given an AstraZeneca shot from the same batch that was used in Austria,
                    formed
                    a blood clot and died.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Danish authorities said they had responded “to reports of possible serious side effects, both from
                    Denmark
                    and other European countries”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It is currently not possible to conclude whether there is a link. We are acting early, it needs to be
                    thoroughly investigated,” Health Minister Magnus Heunicke said on Twitter.

            <h2>Norway follows suit</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Following Denmark’s move, Norway announced later on Thursday that it was also halting the use of the
                    AstraZeneca vaccine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “This is a cautionary decision,” Geir Bukholm, director of infection prevention and control at the
                    Norwegian
                    Institute of Public Health (FHI), told a news conference.
                </p>
                <p>
                    FHI did not say how long the suspension would last.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We … await information to see if there is a link between the vaccination and this case with a blood
                    clot,”
                    Bukholm said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also on Thursday, Italy said it would suspend use of an AstraZeneca batch that was different to the one
                    used
                    in Austria.
                </p>
                <p>
                    AstraZeneca meanwhile told Reuters news agency in a written statement the safety of its vaccine had been
                    extensively studied in human trials, and peer-reviewed data had confirmed the vaccine was generally well
                    tolerated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The drugmaker said earlier this week its shots were subject to strict and rigorous quality controls and
                    that
                    there had been “no confirmed serious adverse events associated with the vaccine”. It also said it was in
                    contact with Austrian authorities and would fully support their investigation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The European Union’s drug regulator, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), said on Wednesday there was no
                    evidence so far linking AstraZeneca to the two cases in Austria.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It said the number of thromboembolic events – marked by the formation of blood clots – in people who
                    have
                    received the AstraZeneca vaccine is no higher than that seen in the general population, with 22 cases of
                    such events being reported among the three million people who have received it as of March 9.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Four other countries – Estonia, Lithuania, Luxembourg and Latvia – have stopped inoculations from the
                    batch
                    while an investigation continues, the EMA said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The batch of one million doses went to 17 EU countries.
                </p>

                <h2>On hold, not opting out, says Denmark</h2>
                <p>
                    Al Jazeera’s Paul Brennan, reporting from London, said Thursday’s moves by Denmark and Norway appeared
                    to
                    have “been borne of an abundance of caution”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “The Danish Health Authority has not given any details of exactly how many blood clot cases there have
                    been,” Brennan said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “But what they did say it was that it was currently not possible to conclude there was a link between
                    the
                    vaccine and these deaths.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    So far, 136,090 Danes have received a shot with AstraZeneca’s vaccine in a country of 5.8 million. The
                    Nordic country also uses vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Denmark’s Health Authority said it had pushed back the final date for when it expects all Danes to have
                    been
                    fully vaccinated by four weeks, to August 15, as a result of the suspension.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sterghios Moschos, a molecular biologist at the UK’s Northumbria University, said Denmark, Norway and
                    other
                    governments were doing the correct thing to “stop and make sure everything was okay” before proceeding
                    with
                    further use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It’s an appropriate response, there is a concern that has been raised, and it needs to be looked at
                    carefully and independently,” Moschos told Al Jazeera.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “But the likelihood, in general, that … a batch of the vaccine may have something wrong with it is very
                    small.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Spain on Thursday said it had not registered any cases of blood clots related to AstraZeneca’s vaccine
                    so
                    far and would continue administering the shots.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Italy’s medicines authority Aifa confirmed that it was halting the use of a batch of doses as a
                    “precautionary” measure, adding that no link had been established between the vaccine and subsequent
                    “serious adverse events”, Reuters news agency reported on Thursday.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It did not specify what incidents it was referring to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, the source said health authorities moved following the deaths this month of Stefano Paterno, a
                    43-year-old navy officer, and Davide Villa, a 50-year-old policeman, who had both received shots from
                    AstraZeneca’s ABV2856 batch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paterno died of a suspected heart attack on Tuesday, the day after his shot. Villa died at the weekend,
                    some
                    12 days after his inoculation.
