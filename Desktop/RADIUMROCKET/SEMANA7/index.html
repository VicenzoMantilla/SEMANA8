                                        Kevin Ring worked on Capitol Hill during the crafting of the 1994 Crime Bill, which imposed tougher prison sentences and bolstered the War on Drugs. As he remembers it, members of both parties were obsessed with appearing tough on crime.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="noticiatextos">
                                        “You couldn’t go far enough,” said Ring, who’s now the president of sentencing reform organization Families Against Mandatory Minimums. “Three strikes? How about two strikes? How about one strike? We couldn’t be punitive enough to satisfy what we thought was public anger about crime and drugs.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="noticiatextos">
                                        Over 25 years after the 1994 Crime Bill and 35 years after the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, the War on Drugs is considered by experts and government officials alike to be one of the biggest failures of American governance in the 20th century. Mandatory minimums, three-strike rules, and expanded felony classifications were not responsible for drops in the crime rate and have not significantly reduced drug use. Instead, these policies ushered in an era of mass incarceration, incited exorbitant federal cost, and have promoted wholly racist outcomes in which one of every three Black boys are expected to go to prison in their lifetimes, compared to just one in every 17 white boys, according to research from the ACLU.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="noticiatextos">
                                        The cocaine sentencing disparity is one of the most notable and obvious manifestations of the racist impact of these laws. The 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act created a 100 to 1 disparity between the amount of crack cocaine that triggers a federal mandatory minimum sentence versus powder cocaine. Five grams of crack mandated a five-year sentence — 500 grams of powder cocaine was required to trigger the same sentence. (Though an Asbury Park Press study found that Black usage of crack was only slightly higher than white usage, crack has been stereotypically associated with Black people while powder cocaine is thought of as a richer, whiter drug.)
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="noticiatextos">
                                        The disparity has been diluted by Congress over the last decade — the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act reformed the disparity to be 18 to 1 instead of 100 to 1, and the 2018 First Step Act made the reform retroactive, allowing people incarcerated for crack offenses to apply for resentencing under the new law.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="noticiatextos">
                                        Now, a small group of lawmakers — a bipartisan one in the House, and two Democrats in the Senate — wants to do away with the disparity altogether and provide the opportunity for retroactive sentence reduction.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="noticiatextos">
                                        “That’s something that you don’t see happen very often, is the government essentially admitting that they were wrong,” said Maritza Perez, the director of national affairs at the Drug Policy Alliance. “But this is one area where there is bipartisan support and where politicians say they messed up.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="noticiatextos">
                                        The Eliminating a Quantifiably Unjust Application of the Law (EQUAL) Act represents the original aim of the Fair Sentencing Act, before it was negotiated down to lessen instead of eliminate the disparity and leave out retroactivity in order to pass with bipartisan support, Rep. Bobby Scott (D-VA), a cosponsor of the EQUAL Act and an original sponsor of the House version of the Fair Sentencing Act, told Vox.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="noticiatextos">
                                        While those earlier bills were enormously bipartisan, there’s no guarantee the EQUAL Act passes the evenly divided Senate, given this exact proposal was watered down in earlier attempts. Right now, no Republicans in the upper chamber have signed on board, let alone the 10 it would take to overcome the filibuster. But if it does pass, advocates are hoping the EQUAL Act can be the launching point for a host of legislation combating racism.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="noticiatextos">
                                        And in the wake of last summer’s racial reckoning, Ring said passing the bill and eliminating the cocaine sentencing disparity should be a “no-brainer,” considering how obviously and overtly racist the policy is.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="noticiatextos">
                                        “There’s lots of ways the justice system discriminates,” Ring said. “They’re not always easy to untangle, because they’re driven by biased humans. ... But this is in the criminal code, so there’s really no excuse for it.”
                                    </p>
                                    <h3 class="segundotitulo">What would the bill fix?</h3>
                                    <p class="noticiatextos">
                                        Arrests for cocaine-related offenses have fallen dramatically from their peak around 1990, according to data from Asbury Park Press, so the law would be most impactful as a means of correcting the disparity’s legacy of racism for people still serving sentences for crack.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="noticiatextos">
                                        The 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act was written based on Congress’s conviction that crack cocaine was more addictive than powder cocaine and incited violent behavior. But those fears proved to be misguided — the two forms are nearly chemically identical; studies have consistently found that crack is no more addictive than powder cocaine, and there is little scientific basis for linking violent crime with crack. The biggest difference between the two forms is that crack is far less expensive than powder cocaine, meaning those involved in its trade were low-level dealers and users being punished as if they were kingpins.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="noticiatextos">
                                        In 2009, one year before the Fair Sentencing Act, the US Sentencing Commission found that 79 percent of convicted crack offenders were Black.

                                    <p class="noticiatextos">
                                        “It exemplified racial injustice in the system,” said Kara Gotsch, deputy director of The Sentencing Project. “The 100 to 1 system epitomized everything wrong with the criminal justice system, and the racism and bias involved in it.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="noticiatextos">
                                        Eighty-one percent of convicted crack offenders in 2019 were Black, according to research from FAMM.

                                        The EQUAL Act’s retroactivity would be critical to achieving some justice for incarcerated drug offenders, advocates said. FAMM research shows the retroactivity feature of the First Step Act has already led to the reduction of over 3,000 crack cocaine sentences, by an average of six years.
                                    </p>

                                        Heather Rice-Minus, senior vice president of advocacy and church mobilization at Prison Fellowship, said there are about 9,000 people still serving time for federal crack cocaine offenses, and about 1,500 new federal sentences issued each year.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="noticiatextos">
                                        While the First Step Act has led to thousands of sentence reductions, the New York Times reported that application of the policy has been somewhat arbitrary due to judicial discretion — there is no guarantee for incarcerated people that a federal judge will accept their application, and the US Sentencing Commission does not track rejections.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="noticiatextos">
                                        The EQUAL Act provides for retroactivity but similarly does not guarantee resentencing. But advocates emphasized the importance of individualized review, both from the perspective of an incarcerated person and because it brings politically important partners like National Defense Attorneys Association on board.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="noticiatextos">
                                        Rep. Scott said individualized review in resentencing allows judges to more effectively resolve issues like “the girlfriend problem,” in which a drug dealer’s girlfriend may have just driven him to a deal or passed a message but received an exorbitant sentence based on the mandatory minimum.
                                    </p>

                                        “(Retroactivity) could have a profound effect on people who have been given sentences, particularly on conspiracy,” Scott said. “Because on conspiracy, you’re addled with the whole weight of the operation, even if part of it was negligible.”
